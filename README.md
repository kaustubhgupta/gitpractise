# gitpractise
Here I practice various GitHub features which I want to learn and implement in various pre-existing projects.

## Currently tried features:
- Git Pull/Push (already done many times)
- Git branching concept (loved this concept to have a copy of working directory seperated from unstable versions)
- Git deployment with heroku (best for quickly releasing public version)
- Git issues (gives update about what to do/fix next)
- Git pull requests (merge changes into branch)

## Features I want to try next:
- Git Actions
- Git Projects (fully exploring it)
- Git Packages
- Git Student Developer Pack
